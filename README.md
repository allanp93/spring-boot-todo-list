## üéØ About The Project

This project is a complete RESTful API for task management (To-Do List), developed as a personal study project in Java and Spring Boot. The application allows users to register, authenticate, and manage their own task lists securely.

The main goal was to apply core backend development concepts, from creating endpoints and validating data to implementing a robust security system with JWT tokens and deploying the application in a production-like environment.
